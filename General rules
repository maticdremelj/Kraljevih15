### **Game Title:** Kraljevih15

### **Game Type:** Turn-based Abstract Strategy Board Game (similar to chess but with more abstract figures that have more available actions)

### **Player Count:** 2 players

### **Game Objective / Win Condition:**
The primary goal in Kraljevih15 is to reduce the opposing King's health to 0. Each King begins the game with 15 health points. Players achieve victory by strategically attacking the enemy King until their health is fully depleted.

## Core Game Loop (High-Level Turn Structure)
One round of Kraljevih15 consists of 14 turns, with each player taking 7 turns per round. The turn order is as follows:

1.  **Round Start:** Player A begins the first round. **Players alternate who starts each subsequent round** (e.g., Player B starts Round 2, Player A starts Round 3, and so on).
2.  **King Turn (Player A):** Player A uses their King. The King, like all figures, has 3 Action Coins (AC) to spend on various actions.
3.  **King Turn (Player B):** Player B uses their King, spending up to 3 AC.
4.  **Figure Selection (Player A):** Player A chooses one of their remaining 6 figures to use, spending up to 3 AC.
5.  **Figure Selection (Player B):** Player B chooses one of their remaining 6 figures, spending up to 3 AC.
6.  **Repeat:** Steps 4 and 5 repeat until both players have used all 7 of their figures.
7.  **Round End:** A new round begins, with Player B starting.

### **Key Game Components & Their Core Functionality:**
* **Game Board:** An **11-row by 7-column grid**, similar to a chessboard. Rows are signed **1-11** and columns **A-G**.
    * Players' figures start on their respective edge rows (e.g., Player 1 on row 1, Player 2 on row 11).
    * The **King figure always starts in the center column (D)** on its respective edge row.
    
* **Player Figures (7 per player): Each player controls 7 unique figures, including their King. Each figure has 3 Action Coins (AC) to spend on its unique actions per turn. Figures cannot move through squares occupied by other figures unless an action specifically allows it.
    * **King:**
      * *HP:* 15 health points. If reduced to 0, the player loses. (Cannot be healed, shielded, or moved by ally troops).
      * *DMG:* 2
      * *Range:* unlimited
      * *Actions:*
         * Do 2 Damage (Cost: 3 AC): Deal 2 damage to any troop on the field. (Enemy or friendly, no matter the range and line of sight)
	 * Give 1 AC to Troop (Cost: 3 AC): Give 1 Action Coin to one of your troops.
	 * Move 1 Tile (Cost: 3 AC): Move for 1 tile.
	 * Grant 3 Temp HP (Cost: 3 AC): Give 3 temporary HP to one of your troops. (Duration: 1 round)
	 * Use Defeated Troop's Actions (Cost: 3 AC): If one of your troops has been defeated, choose one of your still-alive troops. For the current round, the chosen alive troop can use the actions of the defeated troop instead of its own, while retaining its own HP, DMG, and Range. This action counts as the King's turn for the round, and the chosen troop can still take its own regular turn later in the same round if it hasn't already.

* **Health Points (HP):** A numerical value tracking each figure's health.

### **Fundamental Rules & Constraints:**
* **Game Setup - Non-King Figure Placement:**
    * "Players' figures start on their respective edge rows (Player A on row 1, Player B on row 11)."
    * "The King figure always starts in the center column (D) on its respective edge row and its position is fixed."
    * "Before the game begins, players choose their 6 non-King figures and their starting columns (A, B, C, E, F, G) in a draft-style alternating placement. Player A starts the placement."
    * "The first non-King figure placed by each player must occupy the square immediately to the King's right (E column)."
    * "The next non-King figure placed by each player must occupy the square immediately to the King's left (C column)."
    * "Subsequent non-King figures are placed alternating right and left, moving outwards from the King's position (e.g., F column, then B column, then G column, then A column)."
    * "Each non-King figure must occupy a unique column on its starting edge row."
    
* **Movement & Tile Occupancy:**
    * "Only one figure can occupy a single square at any given time."
    * "Figures cannot move through squares occupied by other figures unless an action specifically allows it (e.g., Druid's 'Ascend on New Plane')."
    * "Figures cannot move onto squares occupied by other figures unless an action specifically allows it (e.g., a swap or push ability)."
    * "Movement is only allowed horizontally or vertically, not diagonally."
    * "Movement 'up to X tiles' means a figure can move 1 to X tiles, as long as the path is valid."
    
* **Action Coins (AC):**
    * "Each figure starts its turn with 3 Action Coins (AC) to spend on its unique actions, unless boosted by other actions."
    * "Unspent AC are lost at the end of a figure's turn."
    * "If a figure has no valid actions to perform (either due to insufficient AC, or no valid targets/destinations for its available actions), its turn ends immediately. If a player has no available figures left to select for their turn within a round, their segment of the round ends."

* **Health Points (HP):**
    * "A numerical value tracking each figure's health. If a figure's HP is reduced to 0, it is defeated and removed from the board."
    * "The King's HP is 15. If the opposing King's HP reaches 0, the game ends, and that player wins."

* **Range Calculation:**
    * "Unless otherwise specified, 'Range' for attacks and abilities is calculated using **Manhattan distance** (horizontal or vertical movement only), allowing targeting in any orthogonal (up, down, left, right) direction up to the specified range value. Diagonal targeting is not allowed."

* **Line of Sight (LoS):**
    * "For ranged attacks and abilities, a clear line of sight is generally required to target a figure."
    * "The game board itself contains no impassable obstacles; Line of Sight is only blocked by other figures occupying tiles between the attacker and the target."
    * "Only **enemy figures** block Line of Sight; friendly figures do not block Line of Sight."
    * "The Line of Sight path must be a straight orthogonal line (horizontal or vertical) from the attacker to the target, consistent with range calculation."
    * "Exceptions to these Line of Sight rules are explicitly stated in specific figure action descriptions (e.g., Druid's 'Ascend on New Plane', Ranger's 'Heal Self 2 HP')."

* **Generic 'Attack' Actions:**
    * "Unless an 'Attack' action explicitly states otherwise (e.g., 'deals 2 DMG'), it deals damage equal to the attacking figure's current effective `DMG` value."
    * "A figure's current effective `DMG` value starts at its base `DMG` stat but can be temporarily increased or decreased by other actions or effects for the current turn or round."

* **Temporary HP:**
    * "Temporary HP absorbs incoming damage before a figure's regular HP."
    * "If a figure gains new Temporary HP, it is added to previous Temporary HP; it does stack."
    * "Temporary HP lasts to the end of the round."

* **Shield:**
    * "Shield acts as a buffer that absorbs incoming damage before both Temporary HP and regular HP."
    * "Shields have a distinct value and can be applied by specific actions."
    * "Unlike Temporary HP, certain abilities or attacks can explicitly ignore Shields."
    * "If a figure gains a new Shield, the new amount *replaces* any existing Shield; it does not stack."
    * "Shields last for a specified duration (e.g., 'until Tank's next turn')."

* **Duration Definitions:**
    * "**1 Turn:** The effect lasts until the current figure's turn ends (i.e., after the player clicks 'End Figure Turn' or runs out of AC)."
    * "**1 Round:** The effect lasts until the end of the current game round (after all 14 figure turns, 7 for each player, have been completed and before the next round begins)."

* **Figure Usage Per Round:**
    * "Each figure (including the King) can be used only once per game round. Once a figure has taken its turn, it cannot be selected again until the next round begins."
    * "Exception: If a Goblin is respawned by the King's special ability in a given round, that Goblin becomes available and can be selected for its turn later in the same round."

* **Poison Mechanics:**
    * "If a troop is poisoned, it takes 1 damage at the start of the next 3 of the poisoned troop's player's turns (e.g., if Player A poisons Player B's troop, the damage is taken when Player B starts their turn)."
    * "Poison damage ignores both **Shield** and **Temporary HP**."
    * "Poison effects do not stack (i.e., multiple poison applications do not increase the damage or extend the duration beyond the initial 3 turns)."
